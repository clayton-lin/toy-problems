// Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection

// i: arr1 = [1,3,3,1], arr2 = [3,3]
// o: [3,3]

// i: arr1 = [3,8,5], arr2 = [8,3,8,7,4]
// o: [4,9]

// each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays
// the reasult can be in any order

// what if the array is already sorted? how would you optimize?
// what if arr1 size is small compared to arr2? which algo is better?
// what if elements of arr2 are stored on disk and memory is limited
// such that you cannot load all elements into memory at once?
