// Print all the "magic numbers" between 100 and 1000.

// A magic number is defined as an integer which
// 1) Has no repeating digits
// 2) follows the "magic pattern"

// The magic pattern goes as follows:
//   Start with the leftmost digit N, and from that position move N units to the right, 
//   rolling over as needed. Repeat the process with the new digit you are looking at. 
//   Continue this process. A magic number will encounter each digit only once to end 
//   on the leftmost digit.

// Example Magic Number
// 1623
// starting with 1, move 1 digit to the right to hit 6.
// starting at 6, move 6 digits to the right (wrapping around once) to hit 3
// starting at 3, move 3 digits to the right (wrapping around once) to hit 2
// starting at 2, move 2 digits to the right (wrapping around once) to finish on 1
