// Write a function that returns an array that contains the power set of a given string.
// The power set is a set of all the possible subsets, including the empty set.
// Code should include the following:
  // All characters in a subset should be sorted alphabetically, and the array of subsets should be sorted alphabetically.
  // Sets of the same characters are considered duplicates regardless of order and count only once, e.g. ‘ab’ and ‘ba’ are the same.
  // Duplicate characters in strings should be ignored

const powerSet = () => {


  // time complexity: O()
  // space complexity: O()

};
